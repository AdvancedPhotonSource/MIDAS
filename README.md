# MIDAS

**** V5 Released ****

Code for reduction of Near-Field and Far-Field High Energy Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM) data.

Neldermead is taken from http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/asa047/asa047.html and modified to include constraints and use as CUDA kernels.

SGInfo library used to calculate HKLs.

Some misorientation functions are taken from the ODFPF package from Cornell (https://anisotropy.mae.cornell.edu/onr/Matlab/matlab-functions.html).

Downloads jre, swift binary, NLOPT, LIBTIFF, NETCDF (curl, hdf5, zlib) for compilation of N(F)F-HEDM codes.
